# Customer-Analytics-Experimentation-and-uplift-testing
# Overview
This repository contains code for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and performance evaluation of retail stores. The project aims to analyze transaction and customer data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can inform business decisions and strategies.

# Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Perform EDA on transaction and customer data to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and market dynamics.
# Key Steps:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Transaction analysis: sales, quantities, product names
Customer segmentation based on demographics and purchasing behavior
Analysis of sales trends, customer preferences, and brand affiliations
Evaluation of marketing strategies and promotions using statistical tests and visualizations
# Task 2: Comparative Analysis and Performance Evaluation
Objective: Conduct a comparative analysis between a trial store and control stores to evaluate the impact of interventions or changes.
# Key Steps:
Comparative analysis of pre-trial and post-trial performance metrics
Statistical methods such as correlation analysis and t-tests
Assessment of sales, customer engagement, and market share growth
Determination of intervention success based on performance differences
